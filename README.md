# Lab-6
i studied the SOLID principles and checked my code again to clean in up. i tried to adjust my code after each principle and change the code in a way so it is readble for everyone. I created some function so there will be no repetitions in the code and everyone else should be able to understand what i wanted to do in each section of the code.
